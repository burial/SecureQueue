SecureQueue
===========

<<<<<<< HEAD
is a streamlined version of Jordon's popular addon [SafeQueue](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info19494-1.00.html). It differs in the following ways:

* Has no configuration or slash commands.
* Uses AddonLoader and won't be loaded until necessary (though it uses extremely little resources, anyway!)
* Removes the message telling you how long the queue took.
