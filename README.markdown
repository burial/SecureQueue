SecureQueue
===========

is a streamlined version of Jordon's popular addon [SafeQueue](http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info19494-1.00.html). It has the following difference:

* Has no configuration or slash commands.
* Takes advantage of AddonLoader (won't be loaded until necessary, though it uses extremely little resources!)
* Removes the message telling you how long the queue took.
